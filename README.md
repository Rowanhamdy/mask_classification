# Face-mask Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview

This project implements an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It demonstrates techniques for data preprocessing, augmentation, and training a neural network to classify images into distinct categories.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Efficiently loads images from a folder and preprocesses them into a format suitable for model training.
- **Model Architecture**: A custom CNN built using TensorFlow/Keras for feature extraction and classification.
- **Training and Validation**: Includes early stopping and model checkpointing for optimal training.
- **Data Augmentation**: Uses `ImageDataGenerator` for enhancing the training data with augmented samples.
- **Evaluation**: Provides accuracy and loss metrics for model performance evaluation.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**:
  - TensorFlow/Keras
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## Usage

1. **Dataset**: Place your dataset in the `data/` folder, structured as:
   ```
   data/
   ├── class1/
   │   ├── image1.jpg
   │   ├── image2.jpg
   ├── class2/
   │   ├── image3.jpg
   │   ├── image4.jpg
   ```

2. **Run the Notebook**:
   Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`face-mask.ipynb`) and execute the cells sequentially.

3. **Train the Model**:
   Adjust parameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size) in the code as needed and train the model.

4. **Evaluate the Model**:
   View evaluation metrics and visualizations to analyze model performance.

## Results

- Model achieved an accuracy of `[91]%` on the validation set.
- [Include any graphs, charts, or sample outputs here.]

## Future Work

- Extend the model to support more classes or datasets.
- Experiment with different architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet.
- Optimize model performance with hyperparameter tuning.
